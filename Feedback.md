Olga, your project on 'Marketplace for Art Objects' is quite a comprehensive piece of work. Let's dive into what can be improved and what you've done well.

### Points for Improvement:

1. **Model Definition**: Although your Django models are clearly defined, you should consider adding some comments to describe the purpose of each class and its fields. This will be helpful for team members or future readers of the code.

2. **Code Duplication**: In views like `store`, `cart`, and `checkout`, there's a lot of duplicated logic to check if a user is authenticated and then fetching the related `Order`. This could be refactored into a helper function.

3. **Error Handling**: In your `try-except` block for fetching the product image URL, you silently fail. While it might be suitable for some instances, logging the exception could help in debugging.

4. **API Views**: You could make use of Django Rest Framework's (DRF) `ModelViewSet` to simplify CRUD operations instead of writing explicit get, put, post, and delete methods.

5. **Loops in Property Methods**: In your `Order` model, the `get_cart_total` and `get_cart_items` methods iterate through all order items. While it works, it might not scale well. You can optimize it by making use of Django's ORM aggregation functionalities.

6. **Data Validation**: For instance, in `processOrder`, you assume that the `total` field in the request will always be correct and float. It's generally better to validate this data more thoroughly.

### Points for Preservation:

1. **Code Organization**: Your code is cleanly divided into different sections, which is very helpful.

2. **Use of Properties**: Good job on using Python's `@property` decorators for model methods that behave like read-only attributes.

3. **RESTful Approach**: Your use of RESTful principles in your API is commendable.

4. **Clear Naming Conventions**: Your variables and methods are well-named, making it easier to follow the code logic
